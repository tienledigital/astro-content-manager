## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the Astro Content Manager, you just need to open the `index.html` file in your browser. For a more detailed guide on setup, functionality, and the technical stack, please see the [**Project Overview**](./OVERVIEW.md).

2.  **Connect:** Open the app, paste your repository URL and your token to connect.
3.  **Setup:** Select your posts directory from the suggested paths or pick one manually.
4.  **Manage:** Use the dashboard to manage your existing content or create new posts!
