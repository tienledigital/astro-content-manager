## üöÄ Getting Started

This tool is an [Astro Integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/).

### 1. Installation

```bash
npm install astro-github-content-manager
```

### 2. Configuration

In your `astro.config.mjs` file, import the integration and add it to the `integrations` array.

```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import react from '@astrojs/react';
import contentManager from 'astro-github-content-manager';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    react(), // Required for the UI
    contentManager({ 
      // The route where the content manager will be available
      route: '/dashboard' 
    })
  ]
});
```

### 3. Generate a GitHub Token

Create a [GitHub Fine-Grained Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?type=beta).

- **Repository access:** Grant it access **only** to the specific repository you want to manage.
- **Permissions:** Under "Repository permissions," set **"Contents"** to **"Read and write"**.

Copy the generated token. You will need it to log in.

### 4. Use the Content Manager

1.  Start your Astro dev server: `npm run dev`.
2.  Navigate to the route you configured (e.g., `http://localhost:4321/dashboard`).
3.  Paste your token to connect to your GitHub repository.
4.  Select your destination directories and start uploading your content!
